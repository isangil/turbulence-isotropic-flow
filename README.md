# turbulence-isotropic-flow
Code to generate velocities and passive scalar turbulent homogeneous flows in a cube w periodic boundary conditions.
Used in IBMs Sp2 with the message passing interface library, coded in Fortran-90
May output realizations of the passive scalar embedded in the flow, velocities.
